<!--  USAGE of the entry "goal" for any AIP_* node:
      goal = "prior; state_index; parameters[*]"

          - prior: this is an int indicating the preferred state. For now it can be 0 or 1, i.e. 0 means isHolding is
                   satisfied, 1 means it is not.
          - state_index: this is an int which indicates which is the desired state on which we should achieve the given
                         prior. The states order: isHolding, isReachable, isAt (indexes are then 0, 1, 2)

          - parameters: this is an array of n elements which can possibly vary in length. For now the parameters for the
                        available actions are:
                             isHolding: (joint_conf[10]; type_of_motion; obj_id)
                             isReachable: (joint_conf[10]; type_of_motion; obj_id)
                             isAt: (joint_conf[10]; type_of_motion; obj_id)

                        The joint_conf[10] is an array of 10 entries specifying the joint conf. for the mobile manipul.
                            to be used with the MPC.
                        The type_of_motion is related to the MPc. It can be 0 = navigation, 1 = fine motion
                        The onj_id will be used to retrieve object properties from the parameter server and in the
                            future from the knowledge base.
                            0 = objPose
                            1 = basketPose
